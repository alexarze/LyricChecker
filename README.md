# LyricChecker
A script written in Python to display the number of "expletives" in each song of an album. This list was compiled by Google for a previous project.

This script is still currently in testing stages, so though it is fully functional, it may still have problems and revisions necessary

# Usage

For macOS:
- Open Terminal
- Browse to the containing folder for the scripts
- Run `python album.py`

For Windows:
- Instructions need to be added

For Linux:
- Instructions need to be added

# Usage Warning
This script rips off of AZLyrics in order to read lyrics. AZLyrics has measures in place to blacklist your IP address for a good amount of time if you submit too many failed URL requests in a certain amount of time.
This given, caution should be used while both testing and using this software; if the program does not find lyrics for your desired album, ***there is a parsing error: do not attempt more than once without code revision.***
I am not responsible for the misuse of this script by any people, though my intent is to prevent this problem from happening in the first place.

# Ideas
- Catch for artist title parsing error for AZLyrics
- Better interface
- Easier launch sequence
- Mobile/web integration?
